## v0.1.1 (Apr 12, 2024)

New vendors:

- Hetzner Cloud

Infrastructure:

â€¼ Breaking changes:

As the database migration tool was just introduced, if you have
been already using SC Crawler to initialize a database and
collect data (e.g. in SCD tables), you will need to let Alembic
know that you are already on v0.1.0 via the below command:

```sh
sc-crawler schemas stamp --revision 98894dffd37c
```
